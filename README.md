## About

M.S. Computer Science at the University of Florida (GPA 3.9).

I design and operate **high-performance backend systems** with a focus on
distributed infrastructure, observability, and data-intensive workloads.
My work includes migrating production services to Kubernetes, optimizing
PostgreSQL for high-cardinality datasets, and building RAG pipelines that
serve tens of thousands of users.

I treat infrastructure as code and documentation as a first-class feature.

## Experience Highlights

**AI & Platform Engineer Intern — University of Florida IT**  
- Built and operated backend services for AI platforms serving 30,000+ active users  
- Designed Prompt Builder using FastAPI, Next.js, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL  
- Reduced P95 latency from 800ms → 480ms using metrics-driven optimization  
- Migrated services to Kubernetes, cutting deploy time from hours to minutes  
- Reduced external LLM API cost by 40% via Redis caching in RAG pipelines  

**Software Development Engineer — Tata Consultancy Services**  
- Built enterprise semantic search and RAG systems over 10M+ documents  
- Owned CI/CD pipelines with zero Sev-1 incidents across 12 months  
- Optimized PostgreSQL and MSSQL queries achieving 50% latency reduction  
- Delivered production services on Azure using Docker and Kubernetes

- Reliability over cleverness  
- Simple systems scale better  
- Production experience matters
